**Ontology Classification**

Ontology can be classified as general or specific, or as reusable or non-reusable. Top-level ontologies deal with fundamental and universal concepts that can be applied across various domains. Because they focus on universality, they are classified as ontologies that are not dependent on specific domains. Sometimes, top-level ontology is also referred to as upper ontology.

**Components of Ontology**

Ontology uses the following components to specify the concepts of a particular domain and the relationships between those concepts:

- **Concept**: A general and essential understanding of things that exist in a specific domain.
- **Attribute**: The properties that describe a concept.
- **Relationship**: The relationships between concepts (inheritance, composition, etc.).
- **Axiom**: Something recognized as 'true' that cannot be proven or does not require proof. Axioms are used to explain consistency between concepts/attributes/relationships through logical expressions, and are useful for verifying logical accuracy or inferring new facts.
- **Instance**: The actual entities of each concept.
- **Constraint**: Regulations that limit the relationships between concepts or the values of attributes.

Roughly, ontology can be constructed with the above components, and various languages have been used to express it.
